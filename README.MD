**Developer's note:**


> This project was initiated by Christian Ryan Macarse also known as 'Mac2'. It seeded up from
> wanting a centralized distribution of data by just one message request. There is no need for 
> writing again new classes and methods for every new project. It will utilize every data that
> the company has into a 119.93.23.210:8080/api submit away!. My legacy project.*
